   - Configure for production deployment

2. **SQL Server** named "onetime-sql-[random]" and **SQL Database** named "OneTimeDb" with:
   - Admin username: onetimeadmin
   - Basic pricing tier
   - Enable firewall rule for Azure services
   - Connection string configured for Entity Framework

3. **Storage Account** named "onetimestorage[random]" with:
   - Standard performance, LRS redundancy
   - Create blob containers: "profile-photos", "message-media", "verification-photos"
   - Enable public blob access for these containers
   - Configure CORS for web access

4. **SignalR Service** named "onetime-signalr" with:
   - Standard tier
   - Configure for real-time messaging
